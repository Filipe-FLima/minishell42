Exit status codes in general:
	exit(0): Successful execution.
	exit(1): Generic error.
	exit(127) : command not found
	exit(12): Specifically for memory errors like ENOMEM.
	exit(130): Ctrl + C SIGINT (interrupt signal)

SAME BEHAVIOR AS BASH:
	should I handle UNCLOSED QUOTE like bash or just return syntax_error and restart the prompt?



TODO: 
	1 - check name of the files rules and implement
	2 - move function to opne file to the child process in execution ( files should be open in parallel )
		input :  cat > out | cat < out should return an error - bash: out: No such file or directory
